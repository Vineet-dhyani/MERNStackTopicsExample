// Node.js is an open source server-side Javascript run-time environment built on Chromeâ€™s JavaScript Engine(V8).
//  Node.js is used for building fast and scalable applications and is an event driven, non-blocking I/O model.

// REPL (READ, EVAL, PRINT, LOOP)=> is a computer environment similar to Shell (Unix/Linux) and command prompt.
//  Node comes with the REPL environment when it is installed. System interacts with the user through outputs
//   of commands/expressions used. It is useful in writing and debugging the codes. The work of REPL can be 
//   understood from its full form:

// Read : It reads the inputs from users and parses it into JavaScript data structure. It is then stored to 
// memory.
// Eval : The parsed JavaScript data structure is evaluated for the results.
// Print : The result is printed after the evaluation.
// Loop : Loops the input command. To come out of NODE REPL, press ctrl+c twice
